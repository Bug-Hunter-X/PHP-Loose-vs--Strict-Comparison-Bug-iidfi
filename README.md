This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP programming related to loose versus strict comparisons. The `bug.php` file showcases a function using loose comparison (`==`), which can lead to unexpected results when comparing values of different types.  The `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version using strict comparison (`===`), ensuring accurate comparisons and avoiding potential errors.
